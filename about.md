## About Me

I am **Tsegaye M. Tashu**, an Assistant Professor in **Natural Language Processing** at the University of Groningen, working within the Machine Learning research group at the Bernoulli Institute.

My research focuses on **human-centered NLP**, with an emphasis on:

- **Multilingual Representation Learning** — especially for low-resource languages like Amharic and North African dialects  
- **AI for Education** — building adaptive learning systems and automated feedback tools  
- **Emotion Recognition** — developing emotionally intelligent dialogue systems

I have extensive teaching experience across institutions in Europe and Africa, and I currently coordinate and teach courses such as **Natural Language Processing**, **Artificial Intelligence**, and **Large Language Models**.

Beyond academia, I mentor student projects and co-develop applied research proposals with social and educational impact.
